## Market Sizing Analysis

# Market Sizing Analysis

Comprehensive market sizing methodologies for calculating Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOME) for startup opportunities.

## Overview

Market sizing provides the foundation for startup strategy, fundraising, and business planning. Calculate market opportunity using three complementary methodologies: top-down (industry reports), bottom-up (customer segment calculations), and value theory (willingness to pay).

## Core Concepts

### The Three-Tier Market Framework

**TAM (Total Addressable Market)**

- Total revenue opportunity if achieving 100% market share
- Defines the universe of potential customers
- Used for long-term vision and market validation
- Example: All email marketing software revenue globally

**SAM (Serviceable Available Market)**

- Portion of TAM targetable with current product/service
- Accounts for geographic, segment, or capability constraints
- Represents realistic addressable opportunity
- Example: AI-powered email marketing for e-commerce in North America

**SOME (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**

- Realistic market share achievable in 3-5 years
- Accounts for competition, resources, and market dynamics
- Used for financial projections and fundraising
- Example: 2-5% of SAM based on competitive landscape

### When to Use Each Methodology

**Top-Down Analysis**

- Use when established market research exists
- Best for mature, well-defined markets
- Validates market existence and growth
- Starts with industry reports and narrows down

**Bottom-Up Analysis**

- Use when targeting specific customer segments
- Best for new or niche markets
- Most credible for investors
- Builds from customer data and pricing

**Value Theory**

- Use when creating new market categories
- Best for disruptive innovations
- Estimates based on value creation
- Calculates willingness to pay for problem solution

## Three-Methodology Framework

### Methodology 1: Top-Down Analysis

Start with total market size and narrow to addressable segments.

**Process:**

1. Identify total market category from research reports
2. Apply geographic filters (target regions)
3. Apply segment filters (target industries/customers)
4. Calculate competitive positioning adjustments

**Formula:**

```
TAM = Total Market Category Size
SAM = TAM × Geographic % × Segment %
SOME = SAM × Realistic Capture Rate (2-5%)
```

**When to use:** Established markets with available research (e.g., SaaS, fintech, e-commerce)

**Strengths:** Quick, uses credible data, validates market existence

**Limitations:** May overestimate for new categories, less granular

### Methodology 2: Bottom-Up Analysis

Build market size from customer segment calculations.

**Process:**

1. Define target customer segments
2. Estimate number of potential customers per segment
3. Determine average revenue per customer
4. Calculate realistic penetration rates

**Formula:**

```
TAM = Σ (Segment Size × Annual Revenue per Customer)
SAM = TAM × (Segments You Can Serve / Total Segments)
SOME = SAM × Realistic Penetration Rate (Year 3-5)
```

**When to use:** B2B, niche markets, specific customer segments

**Strengths:** Most credible for investors, granular, defensible

**Limitations:** Requires detailed customer research, time-intensive

### Methodology 3: Value Theory

Calculate based on value created and willingness to pay.

**Process:**

1. Identify problem being solved
2. Quantify current cost of problem (time, money, inefficiency)
3. Calculate value of solution (savings, gains, efficiency)
4. Estimate willingness to pay (typically 10-30% of value)
5. Multiply by addressable customer base

**Formula:**

```
Value per Customer = Problem Cost × % Solved by Solution
Price per Customer = Value × Willingness to Pay % (10-30%)
TAM = Total Potential Customers × Price per Customer
SAM = TAM × % Meeting Buy Criteria
SOME = SAM × Realistic Adoption Rate
```

**When to use:** New categories, disruptive innovations, unclear existing markets

**Strengths:** Shows value creation, works for new markets

**Limitations:** Requires assumptions, harder to validate

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Define the Market

Clearly specify what market is being measured.

**Questions to answer:**

- What problem is being solved?
- Who are the target customers?
- What's the product/service category?
- What's the geographic scope?
- What's the time horizon?

**Example:**

- Problem: E-commerce companies struggle with email marketing automation
- Customers: E-commerce stores with >$1M annual revenue
- Category: AI-powered email marketing software
- Geography: North America initially, global expansion
- Horizon: 3-5 year opportunity

### Step 2: Gather Data Sources

Identify credible data for calculations.

**Top-Down Sources:**

- Industry research reports (Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
- Government statistics (Census, BLS, trade associations)
- Public company filings and earnings
- Market research firms (Statista, CB Insights, PitchBook)

**Bottom-Up Sources:**

- Customer interviews and surveys
- Sales data and CRM records
- Industry databases (LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, Crunchbase)
- Competitive intelligence
- Academic research

**Value Theory Sources:**

- Customer problem quantification
- Time/cost studies
- ROI case studies
- Pricing research and willingness-to-pay surveys

### Step 3: Calculate TAM

Apply chosen methodology to determine total market.

**For Top-Down:**

1. Find total category size from research
2. Document data source and year
3. Apply growth rate if needed
4. Validate with multiple sources

**For Bottom-Up:**

1. Count total potential customers
2. Calculate average annual revenue per customer
3. Multiply to get TAM
4. Break down by segment

**For Value Theory:**

1. Quantify total addressable customer base
2. Calculate value per customer
3. Estimate pricing based on value
4. Multiply for TAM

### Step 4: Calculate SAM

Narrow TAM to serviceable addressable market.

**Apply Filters:**

- Geographic constraints (regions you can serve)
- Product limitations (features you currently have)
- Customer requirements (size, industry, use case)
- Distribution channel access
- Regulatory or compliance restrictions

**Formula:**

```
SAM = TAM × (% matching all filters)
```

**Example:**

- TAM: $10B global email marketing
- Geographic filter: 40% (North America)
- Product filter: 30% (e-commerce focus)
- Feature filter: 60% (need AI capabilities)
- SAM = $10B × 0.40 × 0.30 × 0.60 = $720M

### Step 5: Calculate SOME

Determine realistic obtainable market share.

**Consider:**

- Current market share of competitors
- Typical market share for new entrants (2-5%)
- Resources available (funding, team, time)
- Go-to-market effectiveness
- Competitive advantages
- Time to achieve (3-5 years typically)

**Conservative Approach:**

```
SOME (Year 3) = SAM × 2%
SOME (Year 5) = SAM × 5%
```

**Example:**

- SAM: $720M
- Year 3 SOME: $720M × 2% = $14.4M
- Year 5 SOME: $720M × 5% = $36M

### Step 6: Validate and Triangulate

Cross-check using multiple methods.

**Validation Techniques:**

1. Compare top-down and bottom-up results (should be within 30%)
2. Check against public company revenues in space
3. Validate customer count assumptions
4. Sense-check pricing assumptions
5. Review with industry experts
6. Compare to similar market categories

**Red Flags:**

- TAM that's too small (< $1B for VC-backed startups)
- TAM that's too large (unsupported by data)
- SOME that's too aggressive (> 10% in 5 years for new entrant)
- Inconsistency between methodologies (> 50% difference)

## Industry-Specific Considerations

### SaaS Markets

**Key Metrics:**

- Number of potential businesses in target segment
- Average contract value (ACV)
- Typical market penetration rates
- Expansion revenue potential

**TAM Calculation:**

```
TAM = Total Target Companies × Average ACV × (1 + Expansion Rate)
```

### Marketplace Markets

**Key Metrics:**

- Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of category
- Take rate (% of GMV you capture)
- Total transactions or users

**TAM Calculation:**

```
TAM = Total Category GMV × Expected Take Rate
```

### Consumer Markets

**Key Metrics:**

- Total addressable users/households
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)

**TAM Calculation:**

```
TAM = Total Users × ARPU × Purchase Frequency per Year
```

### B2B Services

**Key Metrics:**

- Number of target companies by size/industry
- Average project value or retainer
- Typical buying frequency

**TAM Calculation:**

```
TAM = Total Target Companies × Average Deal Size × Deals per Year

## Startup Financial Modeling

# Startup Financial Modeling

Build comprehensive 3-5 year financial models with revenue projections, cost structures, cash flow analysis, and scenario planning for early-stage startups.

## Overview

Financial modeling provides the quantitative foundation for startup strategy, fundraising, and operational planning. Create realistic projections using cohort-based revenue modeling, detailed cost structures, and scenario analysis to support decision-making and investor presentations.

## Core Components

### Revenue Model

**Cohort-Based Projections:**
Build revenue from customer acquisition and retention by cohort.

**Formula:**

```
MRR = Σ (Cohort Size × Retention Rate × ARPU)
ARR = MRR × 12
```

**Key Inputs:**

- Monthly new customer acquisitions
- Customer retention rates by month
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)
- Pricing and packaging assumptions
- Expansion revenue (upsells, cross-sells)

### Cost Structure

**Operating Expenses Categories:**

1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
   - Hosting and infrastructure
   - Payment processing fees
   - Customer support (variable portion)
   - Third-party services per customer

2. **Sales & Marketing (S&M)**
   - Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
   - Marketing programs and advertising
   - Sales team compensation
   - Marketing tools and software

3. **Research & Development (R&D)**
   - Engineering team compensation
   - Product management
   - Design and UX
   - Development tools and infrastructure

4. **General & Administrative (G&A)**
   - Executive team
   - Finance, legal, HR
   - Office and facilities
   - Insurance and compliance

### Cash Flow Analysis

**Components:**

- Beginning cash balance
- Cash inflows (revenue, fundraising)
- Cash outflows (operating expenses, CapEx)
- Ending cash balance
- Monthly burn rate
- Runway (months of cash remaining)

**Formula:**

```
Runway = Current Cash Balance / Monthly Burn Rate
Monthly Burn = Monthly Revenue - Monthly Expenses
```

### Headcount Planning

**Role-Based Hiring Plan:**
Track headcount by department and role.

**Key Metrics:**

- Fully-loaded cost per employee
- Revenue per employee
- Headcount by department (% of total)

**Typical Ratios (Early-Stage SaaS):**

- Engineering: 40-50%
- Sales & Marketing: 25-35%
- G&A: 10-15%
- Customer Success: 5-10%

## Financial Model Structure

### Three-Scenario Framework

**Conservative Scenario (P10):**

- Slower customer acquisition
- Lower pricing or conversion
- Higher churn rates
- Extended sales cycles
- Used for cash management

**Base Scenario (P50):**

- Most likely outcomes
- Realistic assumptions
- Primary planning scenario
- Used for board reporting

**Optimistic Scenario (P90):**

- Faster growth
- Better unit economics
- Lower churn
- Used for upside planning

### Time Horizon

**Detailed Projections: 3 Years**

- Monthly detail for Year 1
- Monthly detail for Year 2
- Quarterly detail for Year 3

**High-Level Projections: Years 4-5**

- Annual projections
- Key metrics only
- Support long-term planning

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Define Business Model

Clarify revenue model and pricing.

**SaaS Model:**

- Subscription pricing tiers
- Annual vs. monthly contracts
- Free trial or freemium approach
- Expansion revenue strategy

**Marketplace Model:**

- GMV projections
- Take rate (% of transactions)
- Buyer and seller economics
- Transaction frequency

**Transactional Model:**

- Transaction volume
- Revenue per transaction
- Frequency and seasonality

### Step 2: Build Revenue Projections

Use cohort-based methodology for accuracy.

**Monthly Customer Acquisition:**
Define new customers acquired each month.

**Retention Curve:**
Model customer retention over time.

**Typical SaaS Retention:**

- Month 1: 100%
- Month 3: 90%
- Month 6: 85%
- Month 12: 75%
- Month 24: 70%

**Revenue Calculation:**
For each cohort, calculate retained customers × ARPU for each month.

### Step 3: Model Cost Structure

Break down costs by category and behavior.

**Fixed vs. Variable:**

- Fixed: Salaries, software, rent
- Variable: Hosting, payment processing, support

**Scaling Assumptions:**

- COGS as % of revenue
- S&M as % of revenue (CAC payback)
- R&D growth rate
- G&A as % of total expenses

### Step 4: Create Hiring Plan

Model headcount growth by role and department.

**Inputs:**

- Starting headcount
- Hiring velocity by role
- Fully-loaded compensation by role
- Benefits and taxes (typically 1.3-1.4x salary)

**Example:**

```
Engineer: $150K salary × 1.35 = $202K fully-loaded
Sales Rep: $100K OTE × 1.30 = $130K fully-loaded
```

### Step 5: Project Cash Flow

Calculate monthly cash position and runway.

**Monthly Cash Flow:**

```
Beginning Cash
+ Revenue Collected (consider payment terms)
- Operating Expenses Paid
- CapEx
= Ending Cash
```

**Runway Calculation:**

```
If Ending Cash < 0:
  Funding Need = Negative Cash Balance
  Runway = 0
Else:
  Runway = Ending Cash / Average Monthly Burn
```

### Step 6: Calculate Key Metrics

Track metrics that matter for stage.

**Revenue Metrics:**

- MRR / ARR
- Growth rate (MoM, YoY)
- Revenue by segment or cohort

**Unit Economics:**

- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- LTV (Lifetime Value)
- CAC Payback Period
- LTV / CAC Ratio

**Efficiency Metrics:**

- Burn multiple (Net Burn / Net New ARR)
- Magic number (Net New ARR / S&M Spend)
- Rule of 40 (Growth % + Profit Margin %)

**Cash Metrics:**

- Monthly burn rate
- Runway (months)
- Cash efficiency

### Step 7: Scenario Analysis

Create three scenarios with different assumptions.

**Variable Assumptions:**

- Customer acquisition rate (±30%)
- Churn rate (±20%)
- Average contract value (±15%)
- CAC (±25%)

**Fixed Assumptions:**

- Pricing structure
- Core operating expenses
- Hiring plan (adjust timing, not roles)

## Business Model Templates

### SaaS Financial Model

**Revenue Drivers:**

- New MRR (customers × ARPU)
- Expansion MRR (upsells)
- Contraction MRR (downgrades)
- Churned MRR (lost customers)

**Key Ratios:**

- Gross margin: 75-85%
- S&M as % revenue: 40-60% (early stage)
- CAC payback: < 12 months
- Net retention: 100-120%

**Example Projection:**

```
Year 1: $500K ARR, 50 customers, $100K MRR by Dec
Year 2: $2.5M ARR, 200 customers, $208K MRR by Dec
Year 3: $8M ARR, 600 customers, $667K MRR by Dec
```

### Marketplace Financial Model

**Revenue Drivers:**

- GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)
- Take rate (% of GMV)
- Net revenue = GMV × Take rate

**Key Ratios:**

- Take rate: 10-30% depending on category
- CAC for buyers vs. sellers
- Contribution margin: 60-70%

**Example Projection:**

```
Year 1: $5M GMV, 15% take rate = $750K revenue
Year 2: $20M GMV, 15% take rate = $3M revenue
Year 3: $60M GMV, 15% take rate = $9M revenue
```

### E-Commerce Financial Model

**Revenue Drivers:**

- Traffic (visitors)
- Conversion rate
- Average order value (AOV)
- Purchase frequency

**Key Ratios:**

- Gross margin: 40-60%
- Contribution margin: 20-35%
- CAC payback: 3-6 months

### Services / Agency Financial Model

**Revenue Drivers:**

- Billable hours or projects
- Hourly rate or project fee
- Utilization rate
- Team capacity

**Key Ratios:**

- Gross margin: 50-70%
- Utilization: 70-85%
- Revenue per employee

## Fundraising Integration

### Funding Scenario Modeling

**Pre-Money Valuation:**
Based on metrics and comparables.

**Dilution:**

```
Post-Money = Pre-Money + Investment
Dilution % = Investment / Post-Money
```

**Use of Funds:**
Allocate funding to extend runway and achieve milestones.

**Example:**

```
Raise: $5M at $20M pre-money
Post-Money: $25M
Dilution: 20%

Use of Funds:
- Product Development: $2M (40%)
- Sales & Marketing: $2M (40%)
- G&A and Operations: $0.5M (10%)
- Working Capital: $0.5M (10%)
```

### Milestone-Based Planning

**Identify Key Milestones:**

- Product launch
- First $1M ARR
- Break-even on CAC
- Series A fundraise

**Funding Amount:**
Ensure runway to achieve next milestone + 6 months buffer.

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Overly Optimistic Revenue**

- New startups rarely hit aggressive projections
- Use conservative customer acquisition assumptions
- Model realistic churn rates

**Pitfall 2: Underestimating Costs**

- Add 20% buffer to expense estimates
- Include fully-loaded compensation
- Account for software and tools

**Pitfall 3: Ignoring Cash Flow Timing**

- Revenue ≠ cash (payment terms)
- Expenses paid before revenue collected
- Model cash conversion carefully

**Pitfall 4: Static Headcount**

- Hiring takes time (3-6 months to fill roles)
- Ramp time for productivity (3-6 months)
- Account for attrition (10-15% annually)

**Pitfall 5: Not Scenario Planning**

- Single scenario is never accurate
- Always model conservative case
- Plan for what you'll do if base case fails

## Model Validation

**Sanity Checks:**

- [ ] Revenue growth rate is achievable (3x in Year 2, 2x in Year 3)
- [ ] Unit economics are realistic (LTV/CAC > 3, payback < 18 months)
- [ ] Burn multiple is reasonable (< 2.0 in Year 2-3)
- [ ] Headcount scales with revenue (revenue per employee growing)
- [ ] Gross margin is appropriate for business model
- [ ] S&M spending aligns with CAC and growth targets

**Benchmark Against Peers:**
Compare key metrics to similar companies at similar stage.

**Investor Feedback:**
Share model with advisors or investors for feedback on assumptions.

## Startup Metrics Framework

# Startup Metrics Framework

Comprehensive guide to tracking, calculating, and optimizing key performance metrics for different startup business models from seed through Series A.

## Overview

Track the right metrics at the right stage. Focus on unit economics, growth efficiency, and cash management metrics that matter for fundraising and operational excellence.

## Universal Startup Metrics

### Revenue Metrics

**MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)**

```
MRR = Σ (Active Subscriptions × Monthly Price)
```

**ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)**

```
ARR = MRR × 12
```

**Growth Rate**

```
MoM Growth = (This Month MRR - Last Month MRR) / Last Month MRR
YoY Growth = (This Year ARR - Last Year ARR) / Last Year ARR
```

**Target Benchmarks:**

- Seed stage: 15-20% MoM growth
- Series A: 10-15% MoM growth, 3-5x YoY
- Series B+: 100%+ YoY (Rule of 40)

### Unit Economics

**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**

```
CAC = Total S&M Spend / New Customers Acquired
```

Include: Sales salaries, marketing spend, tools, overhead

**LTV (Lifetime Value)**

```
LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin% × (1 / Churn Rate)
```

Simplified:

```
LTV = ARPU × Average Customer Lifetime × Gross Margin%
```

**LTV:CAC Ratio**

```
LTV:CAC = LTV / CAC
```

**Benchmarks:**

- LTV:CAC > 3.0 = Healthy
- LTV:CAC 1.0-3.0 = Needs improvement
- LTV:CAC < 1.0 = Unsustainable

**CAC Payback Period**

```
CAC Payback = CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin%)
```

**Benchmarks:**

- < 12 months = Excellent
- 12-18 months = Good
- > 24 months = Concerning

### Cash Efficiency Metrics

**Burn Rate**

```
Monthly Burn = Monthly Revenue - Monthly Expenses
```

Negative burn = losing money (typical early-stage)

**Runway**

```
Runway (months) = Cash Balance / Monthly Burn Rate
```

**Target:** Always maintain 12-18 months runway

**Burn Multiple**

```
Burn Multiple = Net Burn / Net New ARR
```

**Benchmarks:**

- < 1.0 = Exceptional efficiency
- 1.0-1.5 = Good
- 1.5-2.0 = Acceptable
- > 2.0 = Inefficient

Lower is better (spending less to generate ARR)

## SaaS Metrics

### Revenue Composition

**New MRR**
New customers × ARPU

**Expansion MRR**
Upsells and cross-sells from existing customers

**Contraction MRR**
Downgrades from existing customers

**Churned MRR**
Lost customers

**Net New MRR Formula:**

```
Net New MRR = New MRR + Expansion MRR - Contraction MRR - Churned MRR
```

### Retention Metrics

**Logo Retention**

```
Logo Retention = (Customers End - New Customers) / Customers Start
```

**Dollar Retention (NDR - Net Dollar Retention)**

```
NDR = (ARR Start + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / ARR Start
```

**Benchmarks:**

- NDR > 120% = Best-in-class
- NDR 100-120% = Good
- NDR < 100% = Needs work

**Gross Retention**

```
Gross Retention = (ARR Start - Churn - Contraction) / ARR Start
```

**Benchmarks:**

- > 90% = Excellent
- 85-90% = Good
- < 85% = Concerning

### SaaS-Specific Metrics

**Magic Number**

```
Magic Number = Net New ARR (quarter) / S&M Spend (prior quarter)
```

**Benchmarks:**

- > 0.75 = Efficient, ready to scale
- 0.5-0.75 = Moderate efficiency
- < 0.5 = Inefficient, don't scale yet

**Rule of 40**

```
Rule of 40 = Revenue Growth Rate% + Profit Margin%
```

**Benchmarks:**

- > 40% = Excellent
- 20-40% = Acceptable
- < 20% = Needs improvement

**Example:**
50% growth + (10%) margin = 40% ✓

**Quick Ratio**

```
Quick Ratio = (New MRR + Expansion MRR) / (Churned MRR + Contraction MRR)
```

**Benchmarks:**

- > 4.0 = Healthy growth
- 2.0-4.0 = Moderate
- < 2.0 = Churn problem

## Marketplace Metrics

### GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)

**Total Transaction Volume:**

```
GMV = Σ (Transaction Value)
```

**Growth Rate:**

```
GMV Growth Rate = (Current Period GMV - Prior Period GMV) / Prior Period GMV
```

**Target:** 20%+ MoM early-stage

### Take Rate

```
Take Rate = Net Revenue / GMV
```

**Typical Ranges:**

- Payment processors: 2-3%
- E-commerce marketplaces: 10-20%
- Service marketplaces: 15-25%
- High-value B2B: 5-15%

### Marketplace Liquidity

**Time to Transaction**
How long from listing to sale/match?

**Fill Rate**
% of requests that result in transaction

**Repeat Rate**
% of users who transact multiple times

**Benchmarks:**

- Fill rate > 80% = Strong liquidity
- Repeat rate > 60% = Strong retention

### Marketplace Balance

**Supply/Demand Ratio:**
Track relative growth of supply and demand sides.

**Warning Signs:**

- Too much supply: Low fill rates, frustrated suppliers
- Too much demand: Long wait times, frustrated customers

**Goal:** Balanced growth (1:1 ratio ideal, but varies by model)

## Consumer/Mobile Metrics

### Engagement Metrics

**DAU (Daily Active Users)**
Unique users active each day

**MAU (Monthly Active Users)**
Unique users active each month

**DAU/MAU Ratio**

```
DAU/MAU = DAU / MAU
```

**Benchmarks:**

- > 50% = Exceptional (daily habit)
- 20-50% = Good
- < 20% = Weak engagement

**Session Frequency**
Average sessions per user per day/week

**Session Duration**
Average time spent per session

### Retention Curves

**Day 1 Retention:** % users who return next day
**Day 7 Retention:** % users active 7 days after signup
**Day 30 Retention:** % users active 30 days after signup

**Benchmarks (Day 30):**

- > 40% = Excellent
- 25-40% = Good
- < 25% = Weak

**Retention Curve Shape:**

- Flattening curve = good (users becoming habitual)
- Steep decline = poor product-market fit

### Viral Coefficient (K-Factor)

```
K-Factor = Invites per User × Invite Conversion Rate
```

**Example:**
10 invites/user × 20% conversion = 2.0 K-factor

**Benchmarks:**

- K > 1.0 = Viral growth
- K = 0.5-1.0 = Strong referrals
- K < 0.5 = Weak virality

## B2B Metrics

### Sales Efficiency

**Win Rate**

```
Win Rate = Deals Won / Total Opportunities
```

**Target:** 20-30% for new sales team, 30-40% mature

**Sales Cycle Length**
Average days from opportunity to close

**Shorter is better:**

- SMB: 30-60 days
- Mid-market: 60-120 days
- Enterprise: 120-270 days

**Average Contract Value (ACV)**

```
ACV = Total Contract Value / Contract Length (years)
```

### Pipeline Metrics

**Pipeline Coverage**

```
Pipeline Coverage = Total Pipeline Value / Quota
```

**Target:** 3-5x coverage (3-5x pipeline needed to hit quota)

**Conversion Rates by Stage:**

- Lead → Opportunity: 10-20%
- Opportunity → Demo: 50-70%
- Demo → Proposal: 30-50%
- Proposal → Close: 20-40%

## Metrics by Stage

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Vanity Metrics**
Don't focus on:

- Total users (without retention)
- Page views (without engagement)
- Downloads (without activation)

Focus on actionable metrics tied to value.

**Mistake 2: Too Many Metrics**
Track 5-7 core metrics intensely, not 50 loosely.

**Mistake 3: Ignoring Unit Economics**
CAC and LTV are critical even at seed stage.

**Mistake 4: Not Segmenting**
Break down metrics by customer segment, channel, cohort.

**Mistake 5: Gaming Metrics**
Optimize for real business outcomes, not dashboard numbers.

### Total Compensation Formula

```
Total Comp = Base Salary × 1.30 (benefits & taxes) + Equity Value
```

**Fully-Loaded Cost:**

- Base salary
- Payroll taxes (7.65% FICA)
- Benefits (health insurance, 401k): $10K-$15K per employee
- Other (workspace, equipment, software): $5K-$10K per employee

**Rule of Thumb:** Multiply base salary by 1.3-1.4 for fully-loaded cost

### Geographic Adjustments

**San Francisco / New York:** +20-30% above benchmarks
**Seattle / Boston / Los Angeles:** +10-20%
**Austin / Denver / Chicago:** +0-10%
**Remote / Other US Cities:** -10-20%
**International:** Varies widely by country

## Equity Allocation

### Equity by Role and Stage

**Founders:**

- First founder: 40-60%
- Second founder: 20-40%
- Third founder: 10-20%
- Vesting: 4 years with 1-year cliff

**Early Employees (Pre-Seed):**

- First engineer: 0.5-2.0%
- First 5 employees: 0.25-1.0% each

**Seed Stage Hires:**

- VP/Head level: 0.5-1.5%
- Senior IC: 0.1-0.5%
- Mid-level: 0.05-0.25%
- Junior: 0.01-0.1%

**Series A Hires:**

- C-level (CTO, CFO): 1.0-3.0%
- VP level: 0.3-1.0%
- Director level: 0.1-0.5%
- Senior IC: 0.05-0.2%
- Mid-level: 0.01-0.1%
- Junior: 0.005-0.05%

### Equity Pool Sizing

**Option Pool by Round:**

- Pre-Seed: 10-15% reserved
- Seed: 10-15% top-up
- Series A: 10-15% top-up
- Series B+: 5-10% per round

**Pre-Funding Dilution:**
Investors often require option pool creation before investment, diluting founders.

**Example:**

```
Pre-money: $10M
Investors want 15% option pool post-money

Calculation:
Post-money: $15M ($10M + $5M investment)
Option pool: $2.25M (15% × $15M)
Founders diluted by pool creation before new money
```

## Organizational Design

### Reporting Structure

**Pre-Seed:**

```
Founders (flat structure)
├── Contractors
└── First hires (report to founders)
```

**Seed:**

```
CEO
├── Engineering Lead (2-4 engineers)
├── Sales/Growth Lead (1-2 reps)
├── Product Manager
└── Operations
```

**Series A:**

```
CEO
├── CTO / VP Engineering (6-20 people)
│   ├── Engineering Manager(s)
│   └── Individual Contributors
├── VP Sales (5-15 people)
│   ├── Sales Manager
│   ├── Account Executives
│   └── SDRs
├── Head of Product (2-5 people)
│   ├── Product Managers
│   └── Designers
├── Head of Customer Success (2-5 people)
└── CFO / Finance Lead (2-5 people)
    ├── Recruiter
    └── Operations
```

### Span of Control

**Manager Ratios:**

- First-line managers: 4-8 direct reports
- Directors: 3-5 direct reports (managers)
- VPs: 3-5 direct reports (directors)
- CEO: 5-8 direct reports (executive team)

## Full-Time vs. Contract

### Use Full-Time for

- Core product development
- Sales (revenue-generating roles)
- Mission-critical operations
- Institutional knowledge roles

### Use Contractors for

- Specialized short-term needs (legal, accounting)
- Variable workload (design, marketing campaigns)
- Skills outside core competency
- Testing role before FTE hire
- Geographic expansion before permanent presence

### Cost Comparison

**Full-Time:**

- Lower hourly cost
- Benefits and overhead
- Long-term commitment
- Cultural fit matters

**Contract:**

- Higher hourly rate ($75-$200/hour vs. $40-$100/hour FTE equivalent)
- No benefits or overhead
- Flexible engagement
- Easier to scale up/down

## Hiring Velocity

### Realistic Timeline

**Role Opening to Hire:**

- Junior: 6-8 weeks
- Mid-Level: 8-12 weeks
- Senior: 12-16 weeks
- Executive: 16-24 weeks

**Time to Productivity:**

- Junior: 4-6 months
- Mid-Level: 2-4 months
- Senior: 1-3 months
- Executive: 3-6 months

### Planning Buffer

Always add 2-3 months buffer to hiring plans.

**Example:**
If need engineer by July 1:

- Start recruiting: April 1 (12 weeks)
- Productivity: September 1 (2 months ramp)

## Budget Planning

### Compensation as % of Revenue

**Early Stage (Seed):**

- Total comp: 120-150% of revenue (burning cash to grow)
- Engineering: 50-60%
- Sales: 30-40%
- Other: 20-30%

**Growth Stage (Series A):**

- Total comp: 70-100% of revenue
- Engineering: 35-45%
- Sales: 25-35%
- Other: 20-30%

### Headcount Budget Formula

```
Total Comp Budget = Σ (Role Count × Fully-Loaded Cost × % of Year)

Example:
3 Engineers × $202K × 100% = $606K
2 AEs × $230K × 75% (mid-year start) = $345K
1 PM × $162K × 100% = $162K
Total: $1.1M
```
