## Data Storytelling

# Data Storytelling

Transform raw data into compelling narratives that drive decisions and inspire action.

## When to Use This Skill

- Presenting analytics to executives
- Creating quarterly business reviews
- Building investor presentations
- Writing data-driven reports
- Communicating insights to non-technical audiences
- Making recommendations based on data

## Core Concepts

### 1. Story Structure

```
Setup → Conflict → Resolution

Setup: Context and baseline
Conflict: The problem or opportunity
Resolution: Insights and recommendations
```

### 2. Narrative Arc

```
1. Hook: Grab attention with surprising insight
2. Context: Establish the baseline
3. Rising Action: Build through data points
4. Climax: The key insight
5. Resolution: Recommendations
6. Call to Action: Next steps
```

### 3. Three Pillars

| Pillar        | Purpose  | Components                       |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Data**      | Evidence | Numbers, trends, comparisons     |
| **Narrative** | Meaning  | Context, causation, implications |
| **Visuals**   | Clarity  | Charts, diagrams, highlights     |

## Story Frameworks

### Framework 1: The Problem-Solution Story

```markdown
# Customer Churn Analysis

## The Hook

"We're losing $2.4M annually to preventable churn."

## The Context

- Current churn rate: 8.5% (industry average: 5%)
- Average customer lifetime value: $4,800
- 500 customers churned last quarter

## The Problem

Analysis of churned customers reveals a pattern:

- 73% churned within first 90 days
- Common factor: < 3 support interactions
- Low feature adoption in first month

## The Insight

[Show engagement curve visualization]
Customers who don't engage in the first 14 days
are 4x more likely to churn.

## The Solution

1. Implement 14-day onboarding sequence
2. Proactive outreach at day 7
3. Feature adoption tracking

## Expected Impact

- Reduce early churn by 40%
- Save $960K annually
- Payback period: 3 months

## Call to Action

Approve $50K budget for onboarding automation.
```

### Framework 2: The Trend Story

```markdown
# Q4 Performance Analysis

## Where We Started

Q3 ended with $1.2M MRR, 15% below target.
Team morale was low after missed goals.

## What Changed

[Timeline visualization]

- Oct: Launched self-serve pricing
- Nov: Reduced friction in signup
- Dec: Added customer success calls

## The Transformation

[Before/after comparison chart]
| Metric | Q3 | Q4 | Change |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Trial → Paid | 8% | 15% | +87% |
| Time to Value | 14 days| 5 days | -64% |
| Expansion Rate | 2% | 8% | +300% |

## Key Insight

Self-serve + high-touch creates compound growth.
Customers who self-serve AND get a success call
have 3x higher expansion rate.

## Going Forward

Double down on hybrid model.
Target: $1.8M MRR by Q2.
```

### Framework 3: The Comparison Story

```markdown
# Market Opportunity Analysis

## The Question

Should we expand into EMEA or APAC first?

## The Comparison

[Side-by-side market analysis]

### EMEA

- Market size: $4.2B
- Growth rate: 8%
- Competition: High
- Regulatory: Complex (GDPR)
- Language: Multiple

### APAC

- Market size: $3.8B
- Growth rate: 15%
- Competition: Moderate
- Regulatory: Varied
- Language: Multiple

## The Analysis

[Weighted scoring matrix visualization]

| Factor      | Weight | EMEA Score | APAC Score |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Market Size | 25%    | 5          | 4          |
| Growth      | 30%    | 3          | 5          |
| Competition | 20%    | 2          | 4          |
| Ease        | 25%    | 2          | 3          |
| **Total**   |        | **2.9**    | **4.1**    |

## The Recommendation

APAC first. Higher growth, less competition.
Start with Singapore hub (English, business-friendly).
Enter EMEA in Year 2 with localization ready.

## Risk Mitigation

- Timezone coverage: Hire 24/7 support
- Cultural fit: Local partnerships
- Payment: Multi-currency from day 1
```

## Visualization Techniques

### Technique 1: Progressive Reveal

```markdown
Start simple, add layers:

Slide 1: "Revenue is growing" [single line chart]
Slide 2: "But growth is slowing" [add growth rate overlay]
Slide 3: "Driven by one segment" [add segment breakdown]
Slide 4: "Which is saturating" [add market share]
Slide 5: "We need new segments" [add opportunity zones]
```

### Technique 2: Contrast and Compare

```markdown
Before/After:
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ BEFORE │ AFTER │
│ │ │
│ Process: 5 days│ Process: 1 day │
│ Errors: 15% │ Errors: 2% │
│ Cost: $50/unit │ Cost: $20/unit │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘

This/That (emphasize difference):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CUSTOMER A vs B │
│ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ │
│ │ ████████ │ │ ██ │ │
│ │ $45,000 │ │ $8,000 │ │
│ │ LTV │ │ LTV │ │
│ └──────────┘ └──────────┘ │
│ Onboarded No onboarding │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Technique 3: Annotation and Highlight

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))

# Plot the main data
ax.plot(dates, revenue, linewidth=2, color='#2E86AB')

# Add annotation for key events
ax.annotate(
    'Product Launch\n+32% spike',
    xy=(launch_date, launch_revenue),
    xytext=(launch_date, launch_revenue * 1.2),
    fontsize=10,
    arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='#E63946'),
    color='#E63946'
)

# Highlight a region
ax.axvspan(growth_start, growth_end, alpha=0.2, color='green',
           label='Growth Period')

# Add threshold line
ax.axhline(y=target, color='gray', linestyle='--',
           label=f'Target: ${target:,.0f}')

ax.set_title('Revenue Growth Story', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
ax.legend()
```

# Monthly Business Review: January 2024

## THE HEADLINE

Revenue up 15% but CAC increasing faster than LTV

## KEY METRICS AT A GLANCE

┌────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│ MRR │ NRR │ CAC │ LTV │
│ $125K │ 108% │ $450 │ $2,200 │
│ ▲15% │ ▲3% │ ▲22% │ ▲8% │
└────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘

## WHAT'S WORKING

✓ Enterprise segment growing 25% MoM
✓ Referral program driving 30% of new logos
✓ Support satisfaction at all-time high (94%)

## WHAT NEEDS ATTENTION

✗ SMB acquisition cost up 40%
✗ Trial conversion down 5 points
✗ Time-to-value increased by 3 days

## ROOT CAUSE

[Mini chart showing SMB vs Enterprise CAC trend]
SMB paid ads becoming less efficient.
CPC up 35% while conversion flat.

## RECOMMENDATION

1. Shift $20K/mo from paid to content
2. Launch SMB self-serve trial
3. A/B test shorter onboarding

## NEXT MONTH'S FOCUS

- Launch content marketing pilot
- Complete self-serve MVP
- Reduce time-to-value to < 7 days
```

## Writing Techniques

### Headlines That Work

```markdown
BAD: "Q4 Sales Analysis"
GOOD: "Q4 Sales Beat Target by 23% - Here's Why"

BAD: "Customer Churn Report"
GOOD: "We're Losing $2.4M to Preventable Churn"

BAD: "Marketing Performance"
GOOD: "Content Marketing Delivers 4x ROI vs. Paid"

Formula:
[Specific Number] + [Business Impact] + [Actionable Context]
```

### Transition Phrases

```markdown
Building the narrative:
• "This leads us to ask..."
• "When we dig deeper..."
• "The pattern becomes clear when..."
• "Contrast this with..."

Introducing insights:
• "The data reveals..."
• "What surprised us was..."
• "The inflection point came when..."
• "The key finding is..."

Moving to action:
• "This insight suggests..."
• "Based on this analysis..."
• "The implication is clear..."
• "Our recommendation is..."
```

### Handling Uncertainty

```markdown
Acknowledge limitations:
• "With 95% confidence, we can say..."
• "The sample size of 500 shows..."
• "While correlation is strong, causation requires..."
• "This trend holds for [segment], though [caveat]..."

Present ranges:
• "Impact estimate: $400K-$600K"
• "Confidence interval: 15-20% improvement"
• "Best case: X, Conservative: Y"
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Start with the "so what"** - Lead with insight
- **Use the rule of three** - Three points, three comparisons
- **Show, don't tell** - Let data speak
- **Make it personal** - Connect to audience goals
- **End with action** - Clear next steps

### Don'ts

- **Don't data dump** - Curate ruthlessly
- **Don't bury the insight** - Front-load key findings
- **Don't use jargon** - Match audience vocabulary
- **Don't show methodology first** - Context, then method
- **Don't forget the narrative** - Numbers need meaning

## Implementation Patterns

### SQL for KPI Calculations

```sql
-- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
WITH mrr_calculation AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_TRUNC('month', billing_date) AS month,
        SUM(
            CASE subscription_interval
                WHEN 'monthly' THEN amount
                WHEN 'yearly' THEN amount / 12
                WHEN 'quarterly' THEN amount / 3
            END
        ) AS mrr
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE status = 'active'
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', billing_date)
)
SELECT
    month,
    mrr,
    LAG(mrr) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS prev_mrr,
    (mrr - LAG(mrr) OVER (ORDER BY month)) / LAG(mrr) OVER (ORDER BY month) * 100 AS growth_pct
FROM mrr_calculation;

-- Cohort Retention
WITH cohorts AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) AS cohort_month
    FROM users
),
activity AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', event_date) AS activity_month
    FROM user_events
    WHERE event_type = 'active_session'
)
SELECT
    c.cohort_month,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM age(a.activity_month, c.cohort_month)) AS months_since_signup,
    COUNT(DISTINCT a.user_id) AS active_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT a.user_id)::FLOAT / COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id) * 100 AS retention_rate
FROM cohorts c
LEFT JOIN activity a ON c.user_id = a.user_id
    AND a.activity_month >= c.cohort_month
GROUP BY c.cohort_month, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM age(a.activity_month, c.cohort_month))
ORDER BY c.cohort_month, months_since_signup;

-- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', acquired_date) AS month,
    SUM(marketing_spend) / NULLIF(COUNT(new_customers), 0) AS cac,
    SUM(marketing_spend) AS total_spend,
    COUNT(new_customers) AS customers_acquired
FROM (
    SELECT
        DATE_TRUNC('month', u.created_at) AS acquired_date,
        u.id AS new_customers,
        m.spend AS marketing_spend
    FROM users u
    JOIN marketing_spend m ON DATE_TRUNC('month', u.created_at) = m.month
    WHERE u.source = 'marketing'
) acquisition
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', acquired_date);
```

### Python Dashboard Code (Streamlit)

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go

st.set_page_config(page_title="KPI Dashboard", layout="wide")

# Header with date filter
col1, col2 = st.columns([3, 1])
with col1:
    st.title("Executive Dashboard")
with col2:
    date_range = st.selectbox(
        "Period",
        ["Last 7 Days", "Last 30 Days", "Last Quarter", "YTD"]
    )

# KPI Cards
def metric_card(label, value, delta, prefix="", suffix=""):
    delta_color = "green" if delta >= 0 else "red"
    delta_arrow = "▲" if delta >= 0 else "▼"
    st.metric(
        label=label,
        value=f"{prefix}{value:,.0f}{suffix}",
        delta=f"{delta_arrow} {abs(delta):.1f}%"
    )

col1, col2, col3, col4 = st.columns(4)
with col1:
    metric_card("Revenue", 2400000, 12.5, prefix="$")
with col2:
    metric_card("Customers", 12450, 15.2)
with col3:
    metric_card("NPS Score", 72, 5.0)

                 hole=0.4)
    fig.update_layout(height=300)
    st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)

# Cohort Heatmap
st.subheader("Cohort Retention")
cohort_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Cohort': ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May'],

    colorscale='Blues',
    text=cohort_data.iloc[:, 1:].values,
    texttemplate='%{text}%',
    textfont={"size": 12},
))
fig.update_layout(height=250)
st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)

# Alerts Section
st.subheader("Alerts")
alerts = [
    {"level": "error", "message": "Churn rate exceeded threshold (>5%)"},
    {"level": "warning", "message": "Support ticket volume 20% above average"},
]
for alert in alerts:
    if alert["level"] == "error":
        st.error(f"🔴 {alert['message']}")
    elif alert["level"] == "warning":
        st.warning(f"🟡 {alert['message']}")
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Limit to 5-7 KPIs** - Focus on what matters
- **Show context** - Comparisons, trends, targets
- **Use consistent colors** - Red=bad, green=good
- **Enable drilldown** - From summary to detail
- **Update appropriately** - Match metric frequency

### Don'ts

- **Don't show vanity metrics** - Focus on actionable data
- **Don't overcrowd** - White space aids comprehension
- **Don't use 3D charts** - They distort perception
- **Don't hide methodology** - Document calculations
- **Don't ignore mobile** - Ensure responsive design
