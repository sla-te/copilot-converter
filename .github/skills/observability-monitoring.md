## Distributed Tracing

# Distributed Tracing

Implement distributed tracing with Jaeger and Tempo for request flow visibility across microservices.

## Purpose

Track requests across distributed systems to understand latency, dependencies, and failure points.

## When to Use

- Debug latency issues
- Understand service dependencies
- Identify bottlenecks
- Trace error propagation
- Analyze request paths

## Distributed Tracing Concepts

### Trace Structure

```
Trace (Request ID: abc123)
  ↓
Span (frontend) [100ms]
  ↓
Span (api-gateway) [80ms]
  ├→ Span (auth-service) [10ms]
  └→ Span (user-service) [60ms]
      └→ Span (database) [40ms]
```

### Key Components

- **Trace** - End-to-end request journey
- **Span** - Single operation within a trace
- **Context** - Metadata propagated between services
- **Tags** - Key-value pairs for filtering
- **Logs** - Timestamped events within a span

## Jaeger Setup

### Kubernetes Deployment

```bash
# Deploy Jaeger Operator
kubectl create namespace observability
kubectl create -f https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/releases/download/v1.51.0/jaeger-operator.yaml -n observability

# Deploy Jaeger instance
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF

    type: elasticsearch
    options:
      es:
        server-urls: http://elasticsearch:9200
  ingress:
    enabled: true
EOF
```

### Docker Compose

## Application Instrumentation

### OpenTelemetry (Recommended)

#### Python (Flask)

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger.thrift import JaegerExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import SERVICE_NAME, Resource
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from flask import Flask

# Initialize tracer
resource = Resource(attributes={SERVICE_NAME: "my-service"})
provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(JaegerExporter(
    agent_host_name="jaeger",
    agent_port=6831,
))
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

# Instrument Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)

@app.route('/api/users')
def get_users():
    tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

    with tracer.start_as_current_span("get_users") as span:
        span.set_attribute("user.count", 100)
        # Business logic
        users = fetch_users_from_db()
        return {"users": users}

def fetch_users_from_db():
    tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

    with tracer.start_as_current_span("database_query") as span:
        span.set_attribute("db.system", "postgresql")
        span.set_attribute("db.statement", "SELECT * FROM users")
        # Database query
        return query_database()
```

#### Node.js (Express)

```javascript
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node");
const { JaegerExporter } = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger");
const { BatchSpanProcessor } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base");
const { registerInstrumentations } = require("@opentelemetry/instrumentation");
const { HttpInstrumentation } = require("@opentelemetry/instrumentation-http");
const {
  ExpressInstrumentation,
} = require("@opentelemetry/instrumentation-express");

// Initialize tracer
const provider = new NodeTracerProvider({
  resource: { attributes: { "service.name": "my-service" } },
});

const exporter = new JaegerExporter({
  endpoint: "http://jaeger:14268/api/traces",
});

provider.addSpanProcessor(new BatchSpanProcessor(exporter));
provider.register();

// Instrument libraries
registerInstrumentations({
  instrumentations: [new HttpInstrumentation(), new ExpressInstrumentation()],
});

const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/api/users", async (req, res) => {
  const tracer = trace.getTracer("my-service");
  const span = tracer.startSpan("get_users");

  try {
    const users = await fetchUsers();
    span.setAttributes({ "user.count": users.length });
    res.json({ users });
  } finally {
    span.end();
  }
});
```

#### Go

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/jaeger"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource"
    sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
    semconv "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.4.0"
)

func initTracer() (*sdktrace.TracerProvider, error) {
    exporter, err := jaeger.New(jaeger.WithCollectorEndpoint(
        jaeger.WithEndpoint("http://jaeger:14268/api/traces"),
    ))
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    tp := sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
        sdktrace.WithBatcher(exporter),
        sdktrace.WithResource(resource.NewWithAttributes(
            semconv.SchemaURL,
            semconv.ServiceNameKey.String("my-service"),
        )),
    )

    otel.SetTracerProvider(tp)
    return tp, nil
}

func getUsers(ctx context.Context) ([]User, error) {
    tracer := otel.Tracer("my-service")
    ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "get_users")
    defer span.End()

    span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("user.filter", "active"))

    users, err := fetchUsersFromDB(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        span.RecordError(err)
        return nil, err
    }

    span.SetAttributes(attribute.Int("user.count", len(users)))
    return users, nil
}
```

## Context Propagation

### HTTP Headers

```
traceparent: 00-0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c-b7ad6b7169203331-01
tracestate: congo=t61rcWkgMzE
```

### Propagation in HTTP Requests

#### Python

```python
from opentelemetry.propagate import inject

headers = {}
inject(headers)  # Injects trace context

response = requests.get('http://downstream-service/api', headers=headers)
```

#### Node.js

```javascript
const { propagation } = require("@opentelemetry/api");

const headers = {};
propagation.inject(context.active(), headers);

axios.get("http://downstream-service/api", { headers });
```

## Tempo Setup (Grafana)

### Kubernetes Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: tempo-config
data:
  tempo.yaml: |
    server:
      http_listen_port: 3200

  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: tempo
          image: grafana/tempo:latest
          args:
            - -config.file=/etc/tempo/tempo.yaml
          volumeMounts:
            - name: config
              mountPath: /etc/tempo
      volumes:
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: tempo-config
```

**Reference:** See `assets/jaeger-config.yaml.template`

## Sampling Strategies

### Probabilistic Sampling

```yaml
# Sample 1% of traces
sampler:
  type: probabilistic
  param: 0.01
```

### Rate Limiting Sampling

```yaml
# Sample max 100 traces per second
sampler:
  type: ratelimiting
  param: 100
```

### Adaptive Sampling

```python
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.sampling import ParentBased, TraceIdRatioBased

# Sample based on trace ID (deterministic)
sampler = ParentBased(root=TraceIdRatioBased(0.01))
```

## Trace Analysis

### Finding Slow Requests

**Jaeger Query:**

```
service=my-service
duration > 1s
```

### Finding Errors

**Jaeger Query:**

```
service=my-service
error=true
tags.http.status_code >= 500
```

### Service Dependency Graph

Jaeger automatically generates service dependency graphs showing:

- Service relationships
- Request rates
- Error rates
- Average latencies

## Best Practices

1. **Sample appropriately** (1-10% in production)
2. **Add meaningful tags** (user_id, request_id)
3. **Propagate context** across all service boundaries
4. **Log exceptions** in spans
5. **Use consistent naming** for operations
6. **Monitor tracing overhead** (<1% CPU impact)
7. **Set up alerts** for trace errors
8. **Implement distributed context** (baggage)
9. **Use span events** for important milestones
10. **Document instrumentation** standards

## Integration with Logging

### Correlated Logs

```python
import logging
from opentelemetry import trace

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def process_request():
    span = trace.get_current_span()
    trace_id = span.get_span_context().trace_id

    logger.info(
        "Processing request",
        extra={"trace_id": format(trace_id, '032x')}
    )
```

## Troubleshooting

**No traces appearing:**

- Check collector endpoint
- Verify network connectivity
- Check sampling configuration
- Review application logs

**High latency overhead:**

- Reduce sampling rate
- Use batch span processor
- Check exporter configuration

## Purpose

Design effective Grafana dashboards for monitoring applications, infrastructure, and business metrics.

## When to Use

- Visualize Prometheus metrics
- Create custom dashboards
- Implement SLO dashboards
- Monitor infrastructure
- Track business KPIs

## Dashboard Design Principles

### 1. Hierarchy of Information

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Critical Metrics (Big Numbers)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Key Trends (Time Series)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Detailed Metrics (Tables/Heatmaps) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. RED Method (Services)

- **Rate** - Requests per second
- **Errors** - Error rate
- **Duration** - Latency/response time

### 3. USE Method (Resources)

- **Utilization** - % time resource is busy
- **Saturation** - Queue length/wait time
- **Errors** - Error count

        "datasource": "Prometheus",
        "query": "label_values(kube_pod_info, namespace)",
        "refresh": 1,
        "multi": false
      },
      {
        "name": "service",
        "type": "query",
        "datasource": "Prometheus",
        "query": "label_values(kube_service_info{namespace=\"$namespace\"}, service)",
        "refresh": 1,
        "multi": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Use Variables in Queries

```
sum(rate(http_requests_total{namespace="$namespace", service=~"$service"}[5m]))
```

## Alerts in Dashboards

```json
{
  "alert": {
    "name": "High Error Rate",
    "conditions": [
      {
        "evaluator": {
          "params": [5],
          "type": "gt"
        },
        "operator": { "type": "and" },
        "query": {
          "params": ["A", "5m", "now"]
        },
        "reducer": { "type": "avg" },
        "type": "query"
      }
    ],
    "executionErrorState": "alerting",
    "for": "5m",
    "frequency": "1m",
    "message": "Error rate is above 5%",
    "noDataState": "no_data",
    "notifications": [{ "uid": "slack-channel" }]
  }
}
```

## Dashboard Provisioning

**dashboards.yml:**

```yaml
apiVersion: 1

providers:
  - name: "default"
    orgId: 1
    folder: "General"
    type: file
    disableDeletion: false
    updateIntervalSeconds: 10
    allowUiUpdates: true
    options:
      path: /etc/grafana/dashboards
```

## Common Dashboard Patterns

### Infrastructure Dashboard

**Key Panels:**

- CPU utilization per node
- Memory usage per node
- Disk I/O
- Network traffic
- Pod count by namespace
- Node status

**Reference:** See `assets/infrastructure-dashboard.json`

### Database Dashboard

**Key Panels:**

- Queries per second
- Connection pool usage
- Query latency (P50, P95, P99)
- Active connections
- Database size
- Replication lag
- Slow queries

**Reference:** See `assets/database-dashboard.json`

### Application Dashboard

**Key Panels:**

- Request rate
- Error rate
- Response time (percentiles)
- Active users/sessions
- Cache hit rate
- Queue length

## Best Practices

1. **Start with templates** (Grafana community dashboards)
2. **Use consistent naming** for panels and variables
3. **Group related metrics** in rows
4. **Set appropriate time ranges** (default: Last 6 hours)
5. **Use variables** for flexibility
6. **Add panel descriptions** for context
7. **Configure units** correctly
8. **Set meaningful thresholds** for colors
9. **Use consistent colors** across dashboards
10. **Test with different time ranges**

## Dashboard as Code

### Terraform Provisioning

```hcl
resource "grafana_dashboard" "api_monitoring" {
  config_json = file("${path.module}/dashboards/api-monitoring.json")
  folder      = grafana_folder.monitoring.id
}

resource "grafana_folder" "monitoring" {
  title = "Production Monitoring"
}
```

### Ansible Provisioning

```yaml
- name: Deploy Grafana dashboards
  copy:
    src: "{{ item }}"
    dest: /etc/grafana/dashboards/
  with_fileglob:
    - "dashboards/*.json"
  notify: restart grafana
```

# /etc/prometheus/rules/recording_rules.yml
groups:
  - name: api_metrics
    interval: 15s
    rules:
      # HTTP request rate per service
      - record: job:http_requests:rate5m
        expr: sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))

      # Error rate percentage
      - record: job:http_requests_errors:rate5m
        expr: sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))

      - record: job:http_requests_error_rate:percentage
        expr: |
          (job:http_requests_errors:rate5m / job:http_requests:rate5m) * 100

      # P95 latency
      - record: job:http_request_duration:p95
        expr: |
          histogram_quantile(0.95,
            sum by (job, le) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
          )

  - name: resource_metrics
    interval: 30s
    rules:
      # CPU utilization percentage
      - record: instance:node_cpu:utilization
        expr: |
          100 - (avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)

      # Memory utilization percentage
      - record: instance:node_memory:utilization
        expr: |
          100 - ((node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) * 100)

      # Disk usage percentage
      - record: instance:node_disk:utilization
        expr: |
          100 - ((node_filesystem_avail_bytes / node_filesystem_size_bytes) * 100)
```

**Reference:** See `references/recording-rules.md`

## Alert Rules

```yaml
# /etc/prometheus/rules/alert_rules.yml
groups:
  - name: availability
    interval: 30s
    rules:
      - alert: ServiceDown
        expr: up{job="my-app"} == 0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Service {{ $labels.instance }} is down"
          description: "{{ $labels.job }} has been down for more than 1 minute"

      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: job:http_requests_error_rate:percentage > 5
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High error rate for {{ $labels.job }}"
          description: "Error rate is {{ $value }}% (threshold: 5%)"

      - alert: HighLatency
        expr: job:http_request_duration:p95 > 1
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High latency for {{ $labels.job }}"
          description: "P95 latency is {{ $value }}s (threshold: 1s)"

  - name: resources
    interval: 1m
    rules:
      - alert: HighCPUUsage
        expr: instance:node_cpu:utilization > 80
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High CPU usage on {{ $labels.instance }}"
          description: "CPU usage is {{ $value }}%"

      - alert: HighMemoryUsage
        expr: instance:node_memory:utilization > 85
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High memory usage on {{ $labels.instance }}"
          description: "Memory usage is {{ $value }}%"

      - alert: DiskSpaceLow
        expr: instance:node_disk:utilization > 90
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Low disk space on {{ $labels.instance }}"
          description: "Disk usage is {{ $value }}%"
```

## Validation

```bash
# Validate configuration
promtool check config prometheus.yml

# Validate rules
promtool check rules /etc/prometheus/rules/*.yml

# Test query
promtool query instant http://localhost:9090 'up'
```

**Reference:** See `scripts/validate-prometheus.sh`

## Best Practices

1. **Use consistent naming** for metrics (prefix_name_unit)
2. **Set appropriate scrape intervals** (15-60s typical)
3. **Use recording rules** for expensive queries
4. **Implement high availability** (multiple Prometheus instances)
5. **Configure retention** based on storage capacity
6. **Use relabeling** for metric cleanup
7. **Monitor Prometheus itself**
8. **Implement federation** for large deployments
9. **Use Thanos/Cortex** for long-term storage
10. **Document custom metrics**

## Troubleshooting

**Check scrape targets:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets
```

**Check configuration:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/status/config
```

**Test query:**

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=up'
```

## Slo Implementation

# SLO Implementation

Framework for defining and implementing Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and error budgets.

## Purpose

Implement measurable reliability targets using SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets to balance reliability with innovation velocity.

## When to Use

- Define service reliability targets
- Measure user-perceived reliability
- Implement error budgets
- Create SLO-based alerts
- Track reliability goals

## SLI/SLO/SLA Hierarchy

```
SLA (Service Level Agreement)
  ↓ Contract with customers
SLO (Service Level Objective)
  ↓ Internal reliability target
SLI (Service Level Indicator)
  ↓ Actual measurement
```

## Defining SLIs

### Common SLI Types

#### 1. Availability SLI

```promql
# Successful requests / Total requests
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status!~"5.."}[28d]))
/
sum(rate(http_requests_total[28d]))
```

#### 2. Latency SLI

```promql
# Requests below latency threshold / Total requests
sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"}[28d]))
/
sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[28d]))
```

#### 3. Durability SLI

```
# Successful writes / Total writes
sum(storage_writes_successful_total)
/
sum(storage_writes_total)
```

**Reference:** See `references/slo-definitions.md`

## Setting SLO Targets

### Availability SLO Examples

| SLO %  | Downtime/Month | Downtime/Year |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| 99%    | 7.2 hours      | 3.65 days     |
| 99.9%  | 43.2 minutes   | 8.76 hours    |
| 99.95% | 21.6 minutes   | 4.38 hours    |
| 99.99% | 4.32 minutes   | 52.56 minutes |

### Choose Appropriate SLOs

**Consider:**

- User expectations
- Business requirements
- Current performance
- Cost of reliability
- Competitor benchmarks

**Example SLOs:**

```yaml
slos:
  - name: api_availability
    target: 99.9
    window: 28d
    sli: |
      sum(rate(http_requests_total{status!~"5.."}[28d]))
      /
      sum(rate(http_requests_total[28d]))

  - name: api_latency_p95
    target: 99
    window: 28d
    sli: |
      sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"}[28d]))
      /
      sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[28d]))
```

## Error Budget Calculation

### Error Budget Formula

```
Error Budget = 1 - SLO Target
```

**Example:**

- SLO: 99.9% availability
- Error Budget: 0.1% = 43.2 minutes/month
- Current Error: 0.05% = 21.6 minutes/month
- Remaining Budget: 50%

### Error Budget Policy

```yaml
error_budget_policy:
  - remaining_budget: 100%
    action: Normal development velocity
  - remaining_budget: 50%
    action: Consider postponing risky changes
  - remaining_budget: 10%
    action: Freeze non-critical changes
  - remaining_budget: 0%
    action: Feature freeze, focus on reliability
```

**Reference:** See `references/error-budget.md`

## SLO Implementation

### Prometheus Recording Rules

## Multi-Window Burn Rate Alerts

```yaml
# Combination of short and long windows reduces false positives
rules:
  - alert: SLOBurnRateHigh
    expr: |
      (
        slo:http_availability:burn_rate_1h > 14.4
        and
        slo:http_availability:burn_rate_5m > 14.4
      )
      or
      (
        slo:http_availability:burn_rate_6h > 6
        and
        slo:http_availability:burn_rate_30m > 6
      )
    labels:
      severity: critical

## SLO Review Process

### Weekly Review

- Current SLO compliance
- Error budget status
- Trend analysis
- Incident impact

### Monthly Review

- SLO achievement
- Error budget usage
- Incident postmortems
- SLO adjustments

### Quarterly Review

- SLO relevance
- Target adjustments
- Process improvements
- Tooling enhancements

## Best Practices

1. **Start with user-facing services**
2. **Use multiple SLIs** (availability, latency, etc.)
3. **Set achievable SLOs** (don't aim for 100%)
4. **Implement multi-window alerts** to reduce noise
5. **Track error budget** consistently
6. **Review SLOs regularly**
7. **Document SLO decisions**
8. **Align with business goals**
9. **Automate SLO reporting**
10. **Use SLOs for prioritization**
