## Architecture Decision Records

# Architecture Decision Records

Comprehensive patterns for creating, maintaining, and managing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that capture the context and rationale behind significant technical decisions.

## When to Use This Skill

- Making significant architectural decisions
- Documenting technology choices
- Recording design trade-offs
- Onboarding new team members
- Reviewing historical decisions
- Establishing decision-making processes

## Core Concepts

### 1. What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures:

- **Context**: Why we needed to make a decision
- **Decision**: What we decided
- **Consequences**: What happens as a result

### 2. When to Write an ADR

| Write ADR                  | Skip ADR               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| New framework adoption     | Minor version upgrades |
| Database technology choice | Bug fixes              |
| API design patterns        | Implementation details |
| Security architecture      | Routine maintenance    |
| Integration patterns       | Configuration changes  |

### 3. ADR Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated → Superseded
              ↓
           Rejected
```

## Templates

### Template 1: Standard ADR (MADR Format)

```markdown
# ADR-0001: Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a primary database for our new e-commerce platform. The system
will handle:

- ~10,000 concurrent users
- Complex product catalog with hierarchical categories
- Transaction processing for orders and payments
- Full-text search for products
- Geospatial queries for store locator

The team has experience with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. We need ACID
compliance for financial transactions.

## Decision Drivers

- **Must have ACID compliance** for payment processing
- **Must support complex queries** for reporting
- **Should support full-text search** to reduce infrastructure complexity
- **Should have good JSON support** for flexible product attributes
- **Team familiarity** reduces onboarding time

## Considered Options

### Option 1: PostgreSQL

- **Pros**: ACID compliant, excellent JSON support (JSONB), built-in full-text
  search, PostGIS for geospatial, team has experience
- **Cons**: Slightly more complex replication setup than MySQL

### Option 2: MySQL

- **Pros**: Very familiar to team, simple replication, large community
- **Cons**: Weaker JSON support, no built-in full-text search (need
  Elasticsearch), no geospatial without extensions

### Option 3: MongoDB

- **Pros**: Flexible schema, native JSON, horizontal scaling
- **Cons**: No ACID for multi-document transactions (at decision time),
  team has limited experience, requires schema design discipline

## Decision

We will use **PostgreSQL 15** as our primary database.

## Rationale

PostgreSQL provides the best balance of:

1. **ACID compliance** essential for e-commerce transactions
2. **Built-in capabilities** (full-text search, JSONB, PostGIS) reduce
   infrastructure complexity
3. **Team familiarity** with SQL databases reduces learning curve
4. **Mature ecosystem** with excellent tooling and community support

The slight complexity in replication is outweighed by the reduction in
additional services (no separate Elasticsearch needed).

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single database handles transactions, search, and geospatial queries
- Reduced operational complexity (fewer services to manage)
- Strong consistency guarantees for financial data
- Team can leverage existing SQL expertise

### Negative

- Need to learn PostgreSQL-specific features (JSONB, full-text search syntax)
- Vertical scaling limits may require read replicas sooner
- Some team members need PostgreSQL-specific training

### Risks

- Full-text search may not scale as well as dedicated search engines
- Mitigation: Design for potential Elasticsearch addition if needed

## Implementation Notes

- Use JSONB for flexible product attributes
- Implement connection pooling with PgBouncer
- Set up streaming replication for read replicas
- Use pg_trgm extension for fuzzy search

## Related Decisions

- ADR-0002: Caching Strategy (Redis) - complements database choice
- ADR-0005: Search Architecture - may supersede if Elasticsearch needed

### Template 2: Lightweight ADR

```markdown
# ADR-0012: Adopt TypeScript for Frontend Development

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Deciders**: @alice, @bob, @charlie

## Context

Our React codebase has grown to 50+ components with increasing bug reports
related to prop type mismatches and undefined errors. PropTypes provide
runtime-only checking.

## Decision

Adopt TypeScript for all new frontend code. Migrate existing code incrementally.

## Consequences

**Good**: Catch type errors at compile time, better IDE support, self-documenting
code.

**Bad**: Learning curve for team, initial slowdown, build complexity increase.

**Mitigations**: TypeScript training sessions, allow gradual adoption with
`allowJs: true`.
```

### Template 3: Y-Statement Format

```markdown
# ADR-0015: API Gateway Selection

In the context of **building a microservices architecture**,
facing **the need for centralized API management, authentication, and rate limiting**,
we decided for **Kong Gateway**
and against **AWS API Gateway and custom Nginx solution**,
to achieve **vendor independence, plugin extensibility, and team familiarity with Lua**,
accepting that **we need to manage Kong infrastructure ourselves**.
```

### Template 4: ADR for Deprecation

```markdown
# ADR-0020: Deprecate MongoDB in Favor of PostgreSQL

## Status

Accepted (Supersedes ADR-0003)

## Context

ADR-0003 (2021) chose MongoDB for user profile storage due to schema flexibility
needs. Since then:

- MongoDB's multi-document transactions remain problematic for our use case
- Our schema has stabilized and rarely changes
- We now have PostgreSQL expertise from other services
- Maintaining two databases increases operational burden

## Decision

Deprecate MongoDB and migrate user profiles to PostgreSQL.

## Migration Plan

1. **Phase 1** (Week 1-2): Create PostgreSQL schema, dual-write enabled
2. **Phase 2** (Week 3-4): Backfill historical data, validate consistency
3. **Phase 3** (Week 5): Switch reads to PostgreSQL, monitor
4. **Phase 4** (Week 6): Remove MongoDB writes, decommission

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single database technology reduces operational complexity
- ACID transactions for user data
- Team can focus PostgreSQL expertise

### Negative

- Migration effort (~4 weeks)
- Risk of data issues during migration
- Lose some schema flexibility

## Lessons Learned

Document from ADR-0003 experience:

- Schema flexibility benefits were overestimated
- Operational cost of multiple databases was underestimated
- Consider long-term maintenance in technology decisions
```

### Template 5: Request for Comments (RFC) Style

```markdown
# RFC-0025: Adopt Event Sourcing for Order Management

## Summary

Propose adopting event sourcing pattern for the order management domain to
improve auditability, enable temporal queries, and support business analytics.

## Motivation

Current challenges:

1. Audit requirements need complete order history
2. "What was the order state at time X?" queries are impossible
3. Analytics team needs event stream for real-time dashboards
4. Order state reconstruction for customer support is manual

## Detailed Design

### Event Store
```

OrderCreated { orderId, customerId, items[], timestamp }
OrderItemAdded { orderId, item, timestamp }
OrderItemRemoved { orderId, itemId, timestamp }
PaymentReceived { orderId, amount, paymentId, timestamp }
OrderShipped { orderId, trackingNumber, timestamp }

```

### Projections

- **CurrentOrderState**: Materialized view for queries
- **OrderHistory**: Complete timeline for audit
- **DailyOrderMetrics**: Analytics aggregation

### Technology

- Event Store: EventStoreDB (purpose-built, handles projections)
- Alternative considered: Kafka + custom projection service

## Drawbacks

- Learning curve for team
- Increased complexity vs. CRUD
- Need to design events carefully (immutable once stored)
- Storage growth (events never deleted)

## Alternatives

1. **Audit tables**: Simpler but doesn't enable temporal queries
2. **CDC from existing DB**: Complex, doesn't change data model
3. **Hybrid**: Event source only for order state changes

## Unresolved Questions

- [ ] Event schema versioning strategy
- [ ] Retention policy for events
- [ ] Snapshot frequency for performance

## Implementation Plan

1. Prototype with single order type (2 weeks)
2. Team training on event sourcing (1 week)
3. Full implementation and migration (4 weeks)
4. Monitoring and optimization (ongoing)

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Write ADRs early** - Before implementation starts
- **Keep them short** - 1-2 pages maximum
- **Be honest about trade-offs** - Include real cons
- **Link related decisions** - Build decision graph
- **Update status** - Deprecate when superseded

### Don'ts

- **Don't change accepted ADRs** - Write new ones to supersede

### Internal Release Notes

```markdown
# Release v2.1.0 - January 15, 2024

## Summary

This release introduces dark mode support and improves checkout performance
by 40%. It also includes important security updates.

## Highlights

### 🌙 Dark Mode

Users can now switch to dark mode from settings. The preference is
automatically saved and synced across devices.

### ⚡ Performance

- Checkout flow is 40% faster
- Reduced bundle size by 15%

## Breaking Changes

None in this release.

## Upgrade Guide

No special steps required. Standard deployment process applies.

## Known Issues

- Dark mode may flicker on initial load (fix scheduled for v2.1.1)

## Dependencies Updated

| Package | From    | To      | Reason                   |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| react   | 18.2.0  | 18.3.0  | Performance improvements |
| lodash  | 4.17.20 | 4.17.21 | Security patch           |
```

## Commit Message Examples

```bash
# Feature with scope
feat(auth): add OAuth2 support for Google login

# Bug fix with issue reference
fix(checkout): resolve race condition in payment processing

Closes #123

# Breaking change
feat(api)!: change user endpoint response format

BREAKING CHANGE: The user endpoint now returns `userId` instead of `id`.
Migration guide: Update all API consumers to use the new field name.

# Multiple paragraphs
fix(database): handle connection timeouts gracefully

Previously, connection timeouts would cause the entire request to fail
without retry. This change implements exponential backoff with up to
3 retries before failing.

The timeout threshold has been increased from 5s to 10s based on p99
latency analysis.

Fixes #456

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Follow Conventional Commits** - Enables automation
- **Write clear messages** - Future you will thank you
- **Reference issues** - Link commits to tickets
- **Use scopes consistently** - Define team conventions
- **Automate releases** - Reduce manual errors

### Don'ts

- **Don't mix changes** - One logical change per commit
- **Don't skip validation** - Use commitlint
- **Don't manual edit** - Generated changelogs only
- **Don't forget breaking changes** - Mark with `!` or footer
- **Don't ignore CI** - Validate commits in pipeline

## Openapi Spec Generation

# OpenAPI Spec Generation

Comprehensive patterns for creating, maintaining, and validating OpenAPI 3.1 specifications for RESTful APIs.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating API documentation from scratch
- Generating OpenAPI specs from existing code
- Designing API contracts (design-first approach)
- Validating API implementations against specs
- Generating client SDKs from specs
- Setting up API documentation portals

## Core Concepts

### 1. OpenAPI 3.1 Structure

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: API Title
  version: 1.0.0
servers:
  - url: https://api.example.com/v1
paths:
  /resources:
    get: ...
components:
  schemas: ...
  securitySchemes: ...
```

### 2. Design Approaches

| Approach         | Description                  | Best For            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Design-First** | Write spec before code       | New APIs, contracts |
| **Code-First**   | Generate spec from code      | Existing APIs       |
| **Hybrid**       | Annotate code, generate spec | Evolving APIs       |

## Templates

### Template 1: Complete API Specification

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: User Management API
  description: |
    API for managing users and their profiles.

    ## Authentication
    All endpoints require Bearer token authentication.

    ## Rate Limiting
    - 1000 requests per minute for standard tier
    - 10000 requests per minute for enterprise tier

## SDK Generation

```bash
# OpenAPI Generator
npm install -g @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli

# Generate TypeScript client
openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i openapi.yaml \
  -g typescript-fetch \
  -o ./generated/typescript-client \
  --additional-properties=supportsES6=true,npmName=@myorg/api-client

# Generate Python client
openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i openapi.yaml \
  -g python \
  -o ./generated/python-client \
  --additional-properties=packageName=api_client

# Generate Go client
openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i openapi.yaml \
  -g go \
  -o ./generated/go-client
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Use $ref** - Reuse schemas, parameters, responses
- **Add examples** - Real-world values help consumers
- **Document errors** - All possible error codes
- **Version your API** - In URL or header
- **Use semantic versioning** - For spec changes

### Don'ts

- **Don't use generic descriptions** - Be specific
- **Don't skip security** - Define all schemes
- **Don't forget nullable** - Be explicit about null
- **Don't mix styles** - Consistent naming throughout
- **Don't hardcode URLs** - Use server variables
