## Progressive Disclosure

Start with the basics and gradually add complexity:

1. **Level 1**: Simple linear pipeline (data → train → deploy)
2. **Level 2**: Add validation and monitoring stages
3. **Level 3**: Implement hyperparameter tuning
4. **Level 4**: Add A/B testing and gradual rollouts
5. **Level 5**: Multi-model pipelines with ensemble strategies

## Common Patterns

### Batch Training Pipeline

```yaml
# See assets/pipeline-dag.yaml.template
stages:
  - name: data_preparation
    dependencies: []
  - name: model_training
    dependencies: [data_preparation]
  - name: model_evaluation
    dependencies: [model_training]
  - name: model_deployment
    dependencies: [model_evaluation]
```

### Real-time Feature Pipeline

```python
# Stream processing for real-time features
# Combined with batch training
# See references/data-preparation.md
```

### Continuous Training

```python
# Automated retraining on schedule
# Triggered by data drift detection
# See references/model-training.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Pipeline failures**: Check dependencies and data availability
- **Training instability**: Review hyperparameters and data quality
- **Deployment issues**: Validate model artifacts and serving config
- **Performance degradation**: Monitor data drift and model metrics

### Debugging Steps

1. Check pipeline logs for each stage
2. Validate input/output data at boundaries
3. Test components in isolation
