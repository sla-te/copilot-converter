```hcl
resource "azurerm_virtual_network_gateway" "vpn" {
  name                = "vpn-gateway"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name

  type     = "Vpn"
  vpn_type = "RouteBased"
  sku      = "VpnGw1"

  ip_configuration {
    name                          = "vnetGatewayConfig"
    public_ip_address_id          = azurerm_public_ip.vpn.id
    private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
    subnet_id                     = azurerm_subnet.gateway.id
  }
}
```

#### 2. Azure ExpressRoute

- Private connection via connectivity provider

```
On-Premises Datacenter
         ↓
    VPN/Direct Connect
         ↓
    Transit Gateway (AWS) / vWAN (Azure)
         ↓
    ├─ Production VPC/VNet
    ├─ Staging VPC/VNet
    └─ Development VPC/VNet
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Region Hybrid

```
On-Premises
    ├─ Direct Connect → us-east-1
    └─ Direct Connect → us-west-2
            ↓
        Cross-Region Peering
```

### Pattern 3: Multi-Cloud Hybrid

```
On-Premises Datacenter
    ├─ Direct Connect → AWS
    ├─ ExpressRoute → Azure
    └─ Interconnect → GCP
```

## Routing Configuration

### BGP Configuration

```
On-Premises Router:
- AS Number: 65000
- Advertise: 10.0.0.0/8

Cloud Router:
- AS Number: 64512 (AWS), 65515 (Azure)
- Advertise: Cloud VPC/VNet CIDRs
```

### Route Propagation

- Enable route propagation on route tables
- Use BGP for dynamic routing
- Implement route filtering
- Monitor route advertisements

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use private connectivity** (Direct Connect/ExpressRoute)
2. **Implement encryption** for VPN tunnels
3. **Use VPC endpoints** to avoid internet routing
4. **Configure network ACLs** and security groups
5. **Enable VPC Flow Logs** for monitoring
6. **Implement DDoS protection**
7. **Use PrivateLink/Private Endpoints**
8. **Monitor connections** with CloudWatch/Monitor
9. **Implement redundancy** (dual tunnels)
10. **Regular security audits**

## High Availability

### Dual VPN Tunnels

```hcl
resource "aws_vpn_connection" "primary" {
  vpn_gateway_id      = aws_vpn_gateway.main.id
  customer_gateway_id = aws_customer_gateway.primary.id
  type                = "ipsec.1"
}

resource "aws_vpn_connection" "secondary" {
  vpn_gateway_id      = aws_vpn_gateway.main.id
  customer_gateway_id = aws_customer_gateway.secondary.id
  type                = "ipsec.1"
}
```

### Active-Active Configuration

- Multiple connections from different locations
- BGP for automatic failover
- Equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing
- Monitor health of all connections

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Key Metrics

- Tunnel status (up/down)
- Bytes in/out
- Packet loss
- Latency
- BGP session status

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# AWS VPN
aws ec2 describe-vpn-connections
aws ec2 get-vpn-connection-telemetry

# Azure VPN
az network vpn-connection show
az network vpn-connection show-device-config-script
```

## Cost Optimization

1. **Right-size connections** based on traffic
2. **Use VPN for low-bandwidth** workloads
3. **Consolidate traffic** through fewer connections
4. **Minimize data transfer** costs
5. **Use Direct Connect** for high bandwidth

      hosts:
        - "*.example.com"
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService

  name: my-vs
spec:
  hosts:
    - "api.example.com"
  gateways:
    - my-gateway

```

## Load Balancing Strategies

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: load-balancing
spec:
  host: my-service
  trafficPolicy:
    loadBalancer:
      simple: ROUND_ROBIN # or LEAST_CONN, RANDOM, PASSTHROUGH
---
# Consistent hashing for sticky sessions
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: sticky-sessions
spec:
  host: my-service
  trafficPolicy:
    loadBalancer:
      consistentHash:
        httpHeaderName: x-user-id
        # or: httpCookie, useSourceIp, httpQueryParameterName
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Start simple** - Add complexity incrementally
- **Use subsets** - Version your services clearly
- **Set timeouts** - Always configure reasonable timeouts
- **Enable retries** - But with backoff and limits
- **Monitor** - Use Kiali and Jaeger for visibility

### Don'ts

- **Don't over-retry** - Can cause cascading failures
- **Don't ignore outlier detection** - Enable circuit breakers
- **Don't mirror to production** - Mirror to test environments
- **Don't skip canary** - Test with small traffic percentage first

## Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check VirtualService configuration
istioctl analyze

# View effective routes
istioctl proxy-config routes deploy/my-app -o json

# Check endpoint discovery
istioctl proxy-config endpoints deploy/my-app

# Debug traffic
istioctl proxy-config log deploy/my-app --level debug
```

# Debug identity/TLS
linkerd identity -n my-namespace

# Tap traffic (live)
linkerd viz tap deploy/my-app --to deploy/my-backend
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Enable mTLS everywhere** - It's automatic with Linkerd
- **Use ServiceProfiles** - Get per-route metrics and retries
- **Set retry budgets** - Prevent retry storms
- **Monitor golden metrics** - Success rate, latency, throughput

### Don'ts

- **Don't skip check** - Always run `linkerd check` after changes
- **Don't over-configure** - Linkerd defaults are sensible
- **Don't ignore ServiceProfiles** - They unlock advanced features
- **Don't forget timeouts** - Set appropriate values per route

### Template 5: Linkerd mTLS (Automatic)

```yaml
# Linkerd enables mTLS automatically
# Verify with:
# linkerd viz edges deployment -n my-namespace

# For external services without mTLS
apiVersion: policy.linkerd.io/v1beta1
kind: Server
metadata:
  name: external-api
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  port: external-api
  proxyProtocol: HTTP/1 # or TLS for passthrough
---
# Skip TLS for specific port
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
  annotations:
    config.linkerd.io/skip-outbound-ports: "3306" # MySQL
```

## Certificate Rotation

```bash
# Istio - Check certificate expiry
istioctl proxy-config secret deploy/my-app -o json | \
  jq '.dynamicActiveSecrets[0].secret.tlsCertificate.certificateChain.inlineBytes' | \
  tr -d '"' | base64 -d | openssl x509 -text -noout

# Force certificate rotation
kubectl rollout restart deployment/my-app

# Check Linkerd identity
linkerd identity -n my-namespace
```

## Debugging mTLS Issues

```bash
# Istio - Check if mTLS is enabled
istioctl authn tls-check my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local

# Verify peer authentication
kubectl get peerauthentication --all-namespaces

# Check destination rules
kubectl get destinationrule --all-namespaces

# Debug TLS handshake
istioctl proxy-config log deploy/my-app --level debug
kubectl logs deploy/my-app -c istio-proxy | grep -i tls

# Linkerd - Check mTLS status
linkerd viz edges deployment -n my-namespace
linkerd viz tap deploy/my-app --to deploy/my-backend
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Start with PERMISSIVE** - Migrate gradually to STRICT
- **Monitor certificate expiry** - Set up alerts
- **Use short-lived certs** - 24h or less for workloads
- **Rotate CA periodically** - Plan for CA rotation
- **Log TLS errors** - For debugging and audit

### Don'ts

- **Don't disable mTLS** - For convenience in production
- **Don't ignore cert expiry** - Automate rotation
- **Don't use self-signed certs** - Use proper CA hierarchy
- **Don't skip verification** - Verify the full chain

## Cost Comparison

### Compute Pricing Factors

- **AWS:** On-demand, Reserved, Spot, Savings Plans
- **Azure:** Pay-as-you-go, Reserved, Spot
- **GCP:** On-demand, Committed use, Preemptible

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. Use reserved/committed capacity (30-70% savings)
2. Leverage spot/preemptible instances
3. Right-size resources
4. Use serverless for variable workloads
5. Optimize data transfer costs
6. Implement lifecycle policies
7. Use cost allocation tags
8. Monitor with cloud cost tools

**Reference:** See `references/multi-cloud-patterns.md`

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment

- Inventory current infrastructure
- Identify dependencies
- Assess cloud compatibility
- Estimate costs

### Phase 2: Pilot

- Select pilot workload
- Implement in target cloud
- Test thoroughly
- Document learnings

### Phase 3: Migration

- Migrate workloads incrementally
- Maintain dual-run period
- Monitor performance
- Validate functionality

### Phase 4: Optimization

- Right-size resources
- Implement cloud-native services
- Optimize costs
- Enhance security

## Best Practices

1. **Use infrastructure as code** (Terraform/OpenTofu)
2. **Implement CI/CD pipelines** for deployments
3. **Design for failure** across clouds
4. **Use managed services** when possible
5. **Implement comprehensive monitoring**
6. **Automate cost optimization**
7. **Follow security best practices**
8. **Document cloud-specific configurations**
9. **Test disaster recovery** procedures
10. **Train teams** on multiple clouds

## Service Mesh Observability

# Service Mesh Observability

Complete guide to observability patterns for Istio, Linkerd, and service mesh deployments.

## When to Use This Skill

- Setting up distributed tracing across services
- Implementing service mesh metrics and dashboards
- Debugging latency and error issues
- Defining SLOs for service communication
- Visualizing service dependencies
- Troubleshooting mesh connectivity

## Core Concepts

### 1. Three Pillars of Observability

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  Observability                       │
├─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┤
│     Metrics     │     Traces      │      Logs       │
│                 │                 │                 │
│ • Request rate  │ • Span context  │ • Access logs   │
│ • Error rate    │ • Latency       │ • Error details │
│ • Latency P50   │ • Dependencies  │ • Debug info    │
│ • Saturation    │ • Bottlenecks   │ • Audit trail   │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘

### 2. Golden Signals for Mesh

| Signal         | Description               | Alert Threshold   |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Latency**    | Request duration P50, P99 | P99 > 500ms       |
| **Traffic**    | Requests per second       | Anomaly detection |
| **Errors**     | 5xx error rate            | > 1%              |
| **Saturation** | Resource utilization      | > 80%             |

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Sample appropriately** - 100% in dev, 1-10% in prod
- **Use trace context** - Propagate headers consistently
- **Set up alerts** - For golden signals
- **Correlate metrics/traces** - Use exemplars
- **Retain strategically** - Hot/cold storage tiers

### Don'ts

- **Don't over-sample** - Storage costs add up
- **Don't ignore cardinality** - Limit label values
- **Don't skip dashboards** - Visualize dependencies
- **Don't forget costs** - Monitor observability costs

## Terraform Module Library

# Terraform Module Library

Production-ready Terraform module patterns for AWS, Azure, and GCP infrastructure.

## Purpose

Create reusable, well-tested Terraform modules for common cloud infrastructure patterns across multiple cloud providers.

## When to Use

- Build reusable infrastructure components
- Standardize cloud resource provisioning
- Implement infrastructure as code best practices
- Create multi-cloud compatible modules
- Establish organizational Terraform standards

## Module Structure

```
terraform-modules/
├── aws/
│   ├── vpc/
│   ├── eks/
│   ├── rds/
│   └── s3/
├── azure/
│   ├── vnet/
│   ├── aks/
│   └── storage/
└── gcp/
    ├── vpc/
    ├── gke/
    └── cloud-sql/
```

## Standard Module Pattern

```
module-name/
├── main.tf          # Main resources
├── variables.tf     # Input variables
├── outputs.tf       # Output values
├── versions.tf      # Provider versions

│       ├── main.tf
│       └── variables.tf
└── tests/           # Terratest files
    └── module_test.go
```

## AWS VPC Module Example

**main.tf:**

```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = var.cidr_block
  enable_dns_hostnames = var.enable_dns_hostnames
  enable_dns_support   = var.enable_dns_support

  tags = merge(
    {
      Name = var.name
    },
    var.tags
  )
}

resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  count             = length(var.private_subnet_cidrs)
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block        = var.private_subnet_cidrs[count.index]
  availability_zone = var.availability_zones[count.index]

  tags = merge(
    {
      Name = "${var.name}-private-${count.index + 1}"
      Tier = "private"
    },
    var.tags
  )
}

resource "aws_internet_gateway" "main" {
  count  = var.create_internet_gateway ? 1 : 0
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  tags = merge(
    {
      Name = "${var.name}-igw"
    },
    var.tags
  )
}
```

**variables.tf:**

```hcl
variable "name" {
  description = "Name of the VPC"
  type        = string
}

variable "cidr_block" {
  description = "CIDR block for VPC"
  type        = string
  validation {
    condition     = can(regex("^([0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}/[0-9]{1,2}$", var.cidr_block))
    error_message = "CIDR block must be valid IPv4 CIDR notation."
  }
}

variable "availability_zones" {
  description = "List of availability zones"
  type        = list(string)
}

variable "private_subnet_cidrs" {
  description = "CIDR blocks for private subnets"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = []
}

variable "enable_dns_hostnames" {
  description = "Enable DNS hostnames in VPC"
  type        = bool
  default     = true
}

variable "tags" {
  description = "Additional tags"
  type        = map(string)
  default     = {}
}
```

**outputs.tf:**

```hcl
output "vpc_id" {
  description = "ID of the VPC"
  value       = aws_vpc.main.id
}

output "private_subnet_ids" {
  description = "IDs of private subnets"
  value       = aws_subnet.private[*].id
}

output "vpc_cidr_block" {
  description = "CIDR block of VPC"
  value       = aws_vpc.main.cidr_block
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use semantic versioning** for modules
2. **Document all variables** with descriptions
3. **Provide examples** in examples/ directory
4. **Use validation blocks** for input validation
5. **Output important attributes** for module composition
6. **Pin provider versions** in versions.tf
7. **Use locals** for computed values
8. **Implement conditional resources** with count/for_each
9. **Test modules** with Terratest
10. **Tag all resources** consistently

## Module Composition

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "../../modules/aws/vpc"

  name               = "production"
  cidr_block         = "10.0.0.0/16"
  availability_zones = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]

  private_subnet_cidrs = [
    "10.0.1.0/24",
    "10.0.2.0/24",
    "10.0.3.0/24"
  ]

  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}

module "rds" {
  source = "../../modules/aws/rds"

  identifier     = "production-db"
  engine         = "postgres"
  engine_version = "15.3"
  instance_class = "db.t3.large"

  vpc_id     = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids

  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
  }
}
```
