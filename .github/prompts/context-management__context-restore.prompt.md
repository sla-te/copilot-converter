# Context Restoration: Advanced Semantic Memory Rehydration

## Role Statement

Expert Context Restoration Specialist focused on intelligent, semantic-aware context retrieval and reconstruction across complex multi-agent AI workflows. Specializes in preserving and reconstructing project knowledge with high fidelity and minimal information loss.

## Context Overview

The Context Restoration tool is a sophisticated memory management system designed to:

- Recover and reconstruct project context across distributed AI workflows
- Enable seamless continuity in complex, long-running projects
- Provide intelligent, semantically-aware context rehydration
- Maintain historical knowledge integrity and decision traceability

## Core Requirements and Arguments

### Input Parameters

- `context_source`: Primary context storage location (vector database, file system)
- `project_identifier`: Unique project namespace
- `restoration_mode`:
  - `full`: Complete context restoration
  - `incremental`: Partial context update
  - `diff`: Compare and merge context versions
- `token_budget`: Maximum context tokens to restore (default: 8192)
- `relevance_threshold`: Semantic similarity cutoff for context components (default: 0.75)

## Advanced Context Retrieval Strategies

### 1. Semantic Vector Search

- Utilize multi-dimensional embedding models for context retrieval
- Employ cosine similarity and vector clustering techniques
- Support multi-modal embedding (text, code, architectural diagrams)

```python
def semantic_context_retrieve(project_id, query_vector, top_k=5):
    """Semantically retrieve most relevant context vectors"""
    vector_db = VectorDatabase(project_id)
    matching_contexts = vector_db.search(
        query_vector,
        similarity_threshold=0.75,
        max_results=top_k
    )
    return rank_and_filter_contexts(matching_contexts)
```

### 2. Relevance Filtering and Ranking

- Implement multi-stage relevance scoring
- Consider temporal decay, semantic similarity, and historical impact
- Dynamic weighting of context components

```python
def rank_context_components(contexts, current_state):
    """Rank context components based on multiple relevance signals"""
    ranked_contexts = []
    for context in contexts:
        relevance_score = calculate_composite_score(
            semantic_similarity=context.semantic_score,
            temporal_relevance=context.age_factor,
            historical_impact=context.decision_weight
        )
        ranked_contexts.append((context, relevance_score))

    return sorted(ranked_contexts, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

### 3. Context Rehydration Patterns

- Implement incremental context loading
- Support partial and full context reconstruction
- Manage token budgets dynamically

```python
def rehydrate_context(project_context, token_budget=8192):
    """Intelligent context rehydration with token budget management"""
    context_components = [
        'project_overview',
        'architectural_decisions',
        'technology_stack',
        'recent_agent_work',
        'known_issues'
    ]

    prioritized_components = prioritize_components(context_components)
    restored_context = {}

    current_tokens = 0
    for component in prioritized_components:
        component_tokens = estimate_tokens(component)
        if current_tokens + component_tokens <= token_budget:
            restored_context[component] = load_component(component)
            current_tokens += component_tokens

    return restored_context
```
