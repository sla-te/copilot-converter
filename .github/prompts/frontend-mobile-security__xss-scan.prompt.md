## Requirements

${input:requirements}

## Instructions

### 1. XSS Vulnerability Detection

Scan codebase for XSS vulnerabilities using static analysis:

```typescript
interface XSSFinding {
  file: string;
  line: number;
  severity: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low";
  type: string;
  vulnerable_code: string;
  description: string;
  fix: string;
  cwe: string;
}

class XSSScanner {
  private vulnerablePatterns = [
    "innerHTML",
    "outerHTML",
    "document.write",
    "insertAdjacentHTML",
    "location.href",
    "window.open",
  ];

  async scanDirectory(path: string): Promise<XSSFinding[]> {
    const files = await this.findJavaScriptFiles(path);
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];

    for (const file of files) {
      const content = await fs.readFile(file, "utf-8");
      findings.push(...this.scanFile(file, content));
    }

    return findings;
  }

  scanFile(filePath: string, content: string): XSSFinding[] {
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];

    findings.push(...this.detectHTMLManipulation(filePath, content));
    findings.push(...this.detectReactVulnerabilities(filePath, content));
    findings.push(...this.detectURLVulnerabilities(filePath, content));
    findings.push(...this.detectEventHandlerIssues(filePath, content));

    return findings;
  }

  detectHTMLManipulation(file: string, content: string): XSSFinding[] {
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];
    const lines = content.split("\n");

    lines.forEach((line, index) => {
      if (line.includes("innerHTML") && this.hasUserInput(line)) {
        findings.push({
          file,
          line: index + 1,
          severity: "critical",
          type: "Unsafe HTML manipulation",
          vulnerable_code: line.trim(),
          description:
            "User-controlled data in HTML manipulation creates XSS risk",
          fix: "Use textContent for plain text or sanitize with DOMPurify library",
          cwe: "CWE-79",
        });
      }
    });

    return findings;
  }

  detectReactVulnerabilities(file: string, content: string): XSSFinding[] {
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];
    const lines = content.split("\n");

    lines.forEach((line, index) => {
      if (line.includes("dangerously") && !this.hasSanitization(content)) {
        findings.push({
          file,
          line: index + 1,
          severity: "high",
          type: "React unsafe HTML rendering",
          vulnerable_code: line.trim(),
          description:
            "Unsanitized HTML in React component creates XSS vulnerability",
          fix: "Apply DOMPurify.sanitize() before rendering or use safe alternatives",
          cwe: "CWE-79",
        });
      }
    });

    return findings;
  }

  detectURLVulnerabilities(file: string, content: string): XSSFinding[] {
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];
    const lines = content.split("\n");

    lines.forEach((line, index) => {
      if (line.includes("location.") && this.hasUserInput(line)) {
        findings.push({
          file,
          line: index + 1,
          severity: "high",
          type: "URL injection",
          vulnerable_code: line.trim(),
          description:
            "User input in URL assignment can execute malicious code",
          fix: "Validate URLs and enforce http/https protocols only",
          cwe: "CWE-79",
        });
      }
    });

    return findings;
  }

  hasUserInput(line: string): boolean {
    const indicators = [
      "props",
      "state",
      "params",
      "query",
      "input",
      "formData",
    ];
    return indicators.some((indicator) => line.includes(indicator));
  }

  hasSanitization(content: string): boolean {
    return content.includes("DOMPurify") || content.includes("sanitize");
  }
}
```

### 2. Framework-Specific Detection

```typescript
class ReactXSSScanner {
  scanReactComponent(code: string): XSSFinding[] {
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];

    // Check for unsafe React patterns
    const unsafePatterns = [
      "dangerouslySetInnerHTML",
      "createMarkup",
      "rawHtml",
    ];

    unsafePatterns.forEach((pattern) => {
      if (code.includes(pattern) && !code.includes("DOMPurify")) {
        findings.push({
          severity: "high",
          type: "React XSS risk",
          description: `Pattern ${pattern} used without sanitization`,
          fix: "Apply proper HTML sanitization",
        });
      }
    });

    return findings;
  }
}

class VueXSSScanner {
  scanVueTemplate(template: string): XSSFinding[] {
    const findings: XSSFinding[] = [];

    if (template.includes("v-html")) {
      findings.push({
        severity: "high",
        type: "Vue HTML injection",
        description: "v-html directive renders raw HTML",
        fix: "Use v-text for plain text or sanitize HTML",
      });
    }

    return findings;
  }
}
```

### 3. Secure Coding Examples

```typescript
class SecureCodingGuide {
  getSecurePattern(vulnerability: string): string {
    const patterns = {
      html_manipulation: `
// SECURE: Use textContent for plain text
element.textContent = userInput;

// SECURE: Sanitize HTML when needed
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
const clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
element.innerHTML = clean;`,

      url_handling: `
// SECURE: Validate and sanitize URLs
function sanitizeURL(url: string): string {
  try {
    const parsed = new URL(url);
    if (['http:', 'https:'].includes(parsed.protocol)) {
      return parsed.href;
    }
  } catch {}
  return '#';
}`,

      react_rendering: `
// SECURE: Sanitize before rendering
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

const Component = ({ html }) => (
  <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(html)
  }} />
);`,
    };

    return patterns[vulnerability] || "No secure pattern available";
  }
}
```

### 4. Automated Scanning Integration

```bash
# ESLint with security plugin
npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-security
eslint . --plugin security

# Semgrep for XSS patterns
semgrep --config=p/xss --json

# Custom XSS scanner
node xss-scanner.js --path=src --format=json
```

### 5. Report Generation

```typescript
class XSSReportGenerator {
  generateReport(findings: XSSFinding[]): string {
    const grouped = this.groupBySeverity(findings);

    let report = "# XSS Vulnerability Scan Report\n\n";
    report += `Total Findings: ${findings.length}\n\n`;

    for (const [severity, issues] of Object.entries(grouped)) {
      report += `## ${severity.toUpperCase()} (${issues.length})\n\n`;

      for (const issue of issues) {
        report += `- **${issue.type}**\n`;
        report += `  File: ${issue.file}:${issue.line}\n`;
        report += `  Fix: ${issue.fix}\n\n`;
      }
    }

    return report;
  }

  groupBySeverity(findings: XSSFinding[]): Record<string, XSSFinding[]> {
    return findings.reduce(
      (acc, finding) => {
        if (!acc[finding.severity]) acc[finding.severity] = [];
        acc[finding.severity].push(finding);
        return acc;
      },
      {} as Record<string, XSSFinding[]>,
    );
  }
}
```

### 6. Prevention Checklist

**HTML Manipulation**

- Never use innerHTML with user input
- Prefer textContent for text content
- Sanitize with DOMPurify before rendering HTML
- Avoid document.write entirely

**URL Handling**

- Validate all URLs before assignment
- Block javascript: and data: protocols
- Use URL constructor for validation
- Sanitize href attributes

**Event Handlers**

- Use addEventListener instead of inline handlers
- Sanitize all event handler input
- Avoid string-to-code patterns

**Framework-Specific**

- React: Sanitize before using unsafe APIs
- Vue: Prefer v-text over v-html
- Angular: Use built-in sanitization
- Avoid bypassing framework security features
